# React + TypeScript To-Do list (WORK IN PROGRESS)

This project was created as a personal exercise to strengthen my knowledge of **React** and **TypeScript**.  
The goal is to build a functional application where I can practice key concepts such as typing props, state and functions, creating reusable components and using hooks.

It is currently in its early development stage.

## Objective

Create a To-do list app witch allows to:

- Create and delete task
- Mark task as finished
- Filtering by state
- Save data using localStorage (tasks and night mode)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Enable/disable night mode

## Technologies used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Local storage
