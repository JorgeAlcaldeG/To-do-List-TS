# React + TypeScript To-Do list

This project was created as a personal exercise to strengthen my knowledge of **React** and **TypeScript**.  
The goal is to build a functional application where I can practice key concepts such as typing props, state and functions, creating reusable components and using hooks.

### Live Preview

Check out the live version of the app: [Live site](https://to-do-list-ts-umber.vercel.app/)

## Objective

Create a To-do list app witch allows to:

- Create and delete task
- Mark task as finished
- Filtering by state
- Save data using localStorage (tasks and night mode)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Enable/disable night mode

## Technologies used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Local storage
- Jest + React testing library

## Features

- Create tasks
- Change task state (created, in progress and finished) click the task for change state, click again when de state is "finished" to set state as "created"
- Delete all task or a single one
- Change between day and night mode
